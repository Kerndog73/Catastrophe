# Catastrophe
An ambitious 2D RPG

This will be the most complex game I have ever created when it is complete. It's the first game large enough to need a heavy weight archiecture like MVC. The engine can already support a big game (lose coupling, data driven). I just need to create the game.

## Plan

I don't have plan for the game. I'm aiming for a similar graphics style to the old pokemon games with a game play similar to Grand Theft Auto. Hopefully I'll think of a story that involves some kind of catastrophe!
